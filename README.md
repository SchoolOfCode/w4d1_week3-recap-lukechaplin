## Get ready for next week

Next week, we'll be delving into NodeJS, which allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser - exciting!

To make sure you're ready to go for this, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download and install the LTS (long-term support) version of Node for your operating system.

## Mindset - from Joseph

Hello all,

I hope you've had a great week!

We know that School of Code is an accelerated learning experience, it's designed that way because we know people are capable of achieving great things. It's a big ask at times and we recognise that as part of the journey it's important to build up your personal resilience. In this week's module we'll look at personal resilience, how we can manage that voice of doubt that can creep into our minds so we can rise to the challenges we want to take on.

[The video is here](https://vimeo.com/652602854/1a7afa815c), and there are also a few [resilience models](./Resilience%20Models.pdf) for you to look at as part of the module (no template this week as you'll be creating your own version of the resilience checklist and it's best if you use a format that works for you).

## Recap tasks

### Task 1

#### Your own site all about you

You challenge is to design a website all about the most amazing person... YOU! You might be tempted to just make a HTML version of a boring old CV... don't! Think about your audiences (likely to be employers, other developers, etc), create your personas, build your user stories, and design a user experience which really helps your audience achieve their goals.

Follow the Design Thinking Process and UX/UI planning we've covered this week. Be sure to document (notes, screenshots, etc.) each stage of your planning in this repository before you build, including:

- Create user personas and user stories - who will be using your app? What needs will this app fulfill?
- Plan your design, and create your wireframes.
- Create a high-fidelity design which looks like the end-product you are hoping to build.

#### ðŸŒŸ Bonus. To be done after submission

Once you're happy with your design process, feel free to start breaking it down and building it out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. **We do not expect this to be completed by the time you hand this assignment in, but it could make for a nice version 1.0 of your portfolio site to work on over the next few weeks of the course**. If you're feeling like you're racing through it (the previous tasks should have taken a lot of time up already, but you never know) you can start to add functionality to your page using your DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript (you can use array methods, add inputs, buttons, etc. with event listeners, and more).

### Task 2

At this point in the course, we've covered the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To give an indicator on how far you've come, we'd like you to give the W3Schools questions a go. There might be some curveballs and things you haven't heard of yet, so don't worry if there's something unfamiliar, but it's a great opportunity to see how far you've progressed on these technologies.
